TO INSTALL:

    (cd to folder with install.sh)  
    chmod 755 install.sh
    sudo ./install.sh ~/history 
    source ~/.bashrc


TO USE:

    annotateHist "TITLE"
        - this will filter your history session (up to previous mark) and open the resulting filtered history in vim.  Once in vim you can edit it and save it.  The default place where the file will be saved is in the installation directory ~/history/histories

    setHistMark "TITLE"
        - sets mark where filter history will STOP filtering.  Only history after the mark will be filtered


NOTE:

    ./ignore_start.txt contains a list of patterns to ignore when a bash history line starts with them.  Spaces count.  The comma is ignored
